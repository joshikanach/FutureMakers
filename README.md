# Sure Start Reflections 

# Day 1 
  Today I got introduced to my team, I learned a little bit about the program, and did some reflecting. 
 
# Day 2 
   Today I attened the leadership meeting. It was super interesting as I saw a new way to actually understand stories of others as well as myself. 
   One thing I liked the best was some of the strategies that were taught about personal narrative, which kind of helped me get an idea for constructing my college essays. 
   Another thing was that I set up Anaconda with my mentor and he helped me navigate through Jupyter Notebook and the required software for back-end development. 

# Day 3 
  What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 
    - Supervised learning is when a computer is fed thousands to millions of coefficients and labeled data to find the optimal solution
    - Unsupervised learning is when a computer fed with unlabeled data, it is told to categorize the data by itself and then find the optimal solutions 
  Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
    - The statement is false because Scikit-learn is focused on ML and not with loading, handling, manupulating, and visualizing of data. 
    
# Day 4 
  Q: Think about a real-world problem and see if you can find a dataset that has the characteristics of the data of that problem. Then, think about the deep learning algorithm that you would likely use to develop a solution to it. Outline why you picked a particular approach. 
  A: A list of cancerous tumors. You could use convolutional neural network. I picked this approach CNN because has memory in order to train themselves. The convolutional neural networks in this case would be the best approach as it can learn from its past mistakes and with the weights and data. 
  
# Day 7
  What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
  Tensors represent the types of data holders, basically there are 4 types. Scalar which is just a single digit like 11 or 3. Vector, which is represented through 1-Dimentional Array. Matrix which is represented through 2-Dimentional Arrays. And finally there are Cubes of Matrices which can hold a, for example, 3 by 3 by 3 data's. 
  What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
  That you can import tensorflow as a package, and call upon tensorflow methods in order for the computer to modify/perform actions that you want it to do.
