# FutureMakers Reflection

# Day 1 
  Today I got introduced to my team, I learned a little bit about the program, and did some reflecting. 
 
# Day 2 
   Today I attened the leadership meeting. It was super interesting as I saw a new way to actually understand stories of others as well as myself. 
   One thing I liked the best was some of the strategies that were taught about personal narrative, which kind of helped me get an idea for constructing my college essays. 
   Another thing was that I set up Anaconda with my mentor and he helped me navigate through Jupyter Notebook and the required software for back-end development. 

# Day 3 
  What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 
    - Supervised learning is when a computer is fed thousands to millions of coefficients and labeled data to find the optimal solution
    - Unsupervised learning is when a computer fed with unlabeled data, it is told to categorize the data by itself and then find the optimal solutions 
  Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
    - The statement is false because Scikit-learn is focused on ML and not with loading, handling, manupulating, and visualizing of data. 
    
# Day 4 
  Q: Think about a real-world problem and see if you can find a dataset that has the characteristics of the data of that problem. Then, think about the deep learning algorithm that you would likely use to develop a solution to it. Outline why you picked a particular approach. 
  A: A list of cancerous tumors. You could use convolutional neural network. I picked this approach CNN because has memory in order to train themselves. The convolutional neural networks in this case would be the best approach as it can learn from its past mistakes and with the weights and data. 
  
# Day 7
  What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
  Tensors represent the types of data holders, basically there are 4 types. Scalar which is just a single digit like 11 or 3. Vector, which is represented through 1-Dimentional Array. Matrix which is represented through 2-Dimentional Arrays. And finally there are Cubes of Matrices which can hold a, for example, 3 by 3 by 3 data's. 
  What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
  That you can import tensorflow as a package, and call upon tensorflow methods in order for the computer to modify/perform actions that you want it to do. 
  
# Day 8 
  This was a pretty interesting day, as my mentor helped me with importing the data for the program. Then I coded the Titanic project. I learned different things throughout
  copying the code from the Kaggle, firstly there is a difference between Mnist data and just regular data that should be imported. I also learned that the training process is
  the longest process, then everything else become easier for the machine. 

# Day 9 
  Today I learned about Convolutional Neural Networks. I visually saw CNN's at work with classifying handwritten digits. I also learned about confusion matrix and how it is evaluated. I also took notes while learning about the different concepts of CNN's which can be found at this link: https://stripe-slipper-21b.notion.site/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-bd2fbd350cd8495f860d9f281dea4444. I also created a project based on a tutorial: https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/convolutional-neural-network-cnn-tutorial. The file is uploaded on GitHub - Introduction to CNN's - Day 9. 

# Day 10 
   How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game? They used my data (the data I fed in or trained the model with) and then used Apple's datasets, in order for the machine to recruit people. Therefore, there was machine learning processes involved with my decision making which impacted the overall output of the recruition of people. Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and
equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model. The most common one, the recruiting process --> the main goal is to have a model that is fair, but sometimes the input and the training aspect of making a model train is very important. I want to create a seperate model, that has been trained of the possible biases that can occur while a different machine learning model can make. By creating this new model, we can implement it into the model that is actually recruiting people, in order to avoid the biases. I know that is it hard to implement it, but we can have a machine that will give the recruiters the common patterns it identified while the recuriting machine is making and from there on, the recruiters can tune the model to how they want the machine to work. 
   
# Day 11
  Today I got a in depth understanding of the different layers in a neural network and the roles of NN in a CNN model. I got to learn that there are differences in CNN models itself, where there are the CNN and the Fully Connected NN. The convolutional layer is the basic or the foundational block of the CNN model. The pooling layer, help break the model into smaller pieces, so that it is easier for the model to solve the given problem or analyze certain patterns in the end. And finally, neurons in this layer have connections and are connected to other neurons in which all the neurons proceed to the conclusion or the output. 

# Day 14 
  Today, I learned about loss functions. I then created a model using a tutorial --> https://hackernoon.com/build-your-first-neural-network-to-predict-house-prices-with-keras-3fb0839680f4 
  I was pretty impressed with the functionalities that loss functions provide with, and it was cool it see it in action when building the model.
    
# Day 15 
  Advantages of ReLU functions: 
    - They are cost-efficient and time saving
    - They only fire a few neurons at a time, which calls for efficiency and the easiness of using the ReLU functions 
    - They learn faster than a Sigmoid or a Tanh function
    - There is a reduced likely hood of vanishing gradient as well, therefore less prone to errors 
 Use case of ReLU function: 
    - ReLU's are usually implemented in hidden layers but can be both in hidden as well as output layers 
    - We can use a ReLU in a multilayer perceptron or in a convenetional neural network
