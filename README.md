# Sure Start Reflections 

# Day 1 
  Today I got introduced to my team, I learned a little bit about the program, and did some reflecting. 
 
# Day 2 
   Today I attened the leadership meeting. It was super interesting as I saw a new way to actually understand stories of others as well as myself. 
   One thing I liked the best was some of the strategies that were taught about personal narrative, which kind of helped me get an idea for constructing my college essays. 
   Another thing was that I set up Anaconda with my mentor and he helped me navigate through Jupyter Notebook and the required software for back-end development. 

# Day 3 
  What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 
    - Supervised learning is when a computer is fed thousands to millions of coefficients and labeled data to find the optimal solution
    - Unsupervised learning is when a computer fed with unlabeled data, it is told to categorize the data by itself and then find the optimal solutions 
  Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
    - The statement is false because Scikit-learn is focused on ML and not with loading, handling, manupulating, and visualizing of data.
