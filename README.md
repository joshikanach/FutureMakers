# Sure Start Reflections 

# Day 1 
  Today I got introduced to my team, I learned a little bit about the program, and did some reflecting. 
 
# Day 2 
   Today I attened the leadership meeting. It was super interesting as I saw a new way to actually understand stories of others as well as myself. 
   One thing I liked the best was some of the strategies that were taught about personal narrative, which kind of helped me get an idea for constructing my college essays. 
   Another thing was that I set up Anaconda with my mentor and he helped me navigate through Jupyter Notebook and the required software for back-end development.
